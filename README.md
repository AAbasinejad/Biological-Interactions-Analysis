# Biological-Interactions-Analysis
Biological interactions network analysis which related to a list of specific (interested) human genes

In this project Biological Interactions Network analysis related to specific  human [seed genes](https://github.com/AAbasinejad/Biological-Interactions-Analysis/blob/master/seed_genes.txt) has been carried out by using [Human Integrated Interactions Database](http://iid.ophid.utoronto.ca/static/download/human_annotated_PPIs.txt.gz) (a.k.a IID) which is an on-line database of detected and predicted protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and [BioGRID](https://downloads.thebiogrid.org/Download/BioGRID/Release-Archive/BIOGRID-3.5.168/BIOGRID-ORGANISM-3.5.168.tab2.zip) which is an interaction repository with data compiled through comprehensive curation efforts.
The BioGRID and IID datasets mentioned above is exactly the ones that has been used in this project but you can find oder formats of same biogrid dataset [here](https://downloads.thebiogrid.org/BioGRID/Release-Archive/BIOGRID-3.5.168/) or other PPI networks databases provided by IID [here](http://iid.ophid.utoronto.ca/search_by_proteins/).
