# Biological-Interactions-Analysis

**Introductions:** Biological interactions network analysis which related to a list of specific (interested) human genes

**Data:** In this project Biological Interactions Network analysis related to specific  human [seed genes](https://github.com/AAbasinejad/Biological-Interactions-Analysis/blob/master/seed_genes.txt) has been carried out by using Human [Integrated Interactions Database](http://iid.ophid.utoronto.ca/static/download/human_annotated_PPIs.txt.gz) (a.k.a IID) which is an on-line database of detected and predicted protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and [BioGRID](https://downloads.thebiogrid.org/Download/BioGRID/Release-Archive/BIOGRID-3.5.168/BIOGRID-ORGANISM-3.5.168.tab2.zip) which is an interaction repository with data compiled through comprehensive curation efforts.<br />
The BioGRID and IID datasets mentioned above is exactly the ones that has been used in this project but you can find other formats of same biogrid dataset [here](https://downloads.thebiogrid.org/BioGRID/Release-Archive/BIOGRID-3.5.168/) or other PPI networks databases provided by IID [here](http://iid.ophid.utoronto.ca/search_by_proteins/).<br />

In order to run this code you have to put all *needed files* in a same directory and run this command in terminal:<br />


`python main.py <seed_genes.txt> <BIOGRID-ORGANISM-Homo_sapiens dataset> <IID dataset>`

**Note**: Needed files are `main.py`, `Basic_info.py`, `Interactions.py`, `Network_Analysis.py` plus the two mentioned datasets. <br/>
**Note**: This project has been done in `Python 3.x`, so ... .<br/>
**P.S.**: running of this code in **lunch break** is strongly recommended. :D <br/>



**Modules:**

TBD soon...
A brief explaination of each module(both technically and conceptually) will be here ASAP. ;) <br/>
